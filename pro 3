3.	Design Deploy and Manage Microservice Architecture using Docker
Aim: To simulate deployment of basic microservice 
Pre-reuisite: docker desktop has to be installed on system
Steps:
STAY IN DESKTOP
If docker desktop is not downloaded download it(choose 64 bit), mostly it will be downloaded, if its not ask them for internet connection(docker desktop installation
proper steps are there in prev program, u can see that if it is not installed)
You want to go to start button and put docker desktop:run as adminstrator, if it does not open but it is installed, then do this:
Go to task manager in start button, and al windows subsystem ones thata re there end tak and remove it, now again try opening it, it should open
Docker hub account: username:1by22cs194@bmsit.in
                                      Password:kinsella1234$
Then go to file explorer create folder microservice-app
Inside app folder:
1. App. Py (a in small):
# File: app/app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello from Microservice App!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)


2.Requirements.txt(r in small):
flask

 3.DockerFile
# File: app/Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]

4. In seprate folder/file put this:docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: ./app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: sampledb
      MYSQL_USER: user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpass
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"

In vs code terminal run:
sudo docker compose up --build
go to this link:http://localhost:5000/
or directly in docker desktop you should see a container:microservice-app and click on it, 2 more thing will appear run them, you shoukd see
welcome to microservice app!
To stop container(do not do it, just if ma'am asks)
docker-compose down

TO FAKE OUTPUT DO SAME THING AS PREVIOUS CODE, JUST CHANGE THE PRINT STATEMEN THAT'S ALL.

Viva:
docker-compose up --build Builds and starts all services defined in the Compose file
docker ps Lists all running containers (for verification)
docker-compose down Stops and removes all containers, networks, and volumes created

NOW SEE IN CASE WINDOWS DOES NOT HAVE DOCKER DESKTOP
USE UBUNTU
STEPS:
1.Open ubuntu in VMWare
2.Install Docker+ Compose in Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
3.	Check Docker
docker –version
docker compose version
OR IF IT DOES NOT WORK IN TERMINAL
ps aux | grep -i apt
you will see:root      1234  0.0  0.1  123456  5678 ?  S   10:00   0:00 apt-get update
sudo kill -9 <PID> whic is 1234 without bracket
sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock*
sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose-plugin
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
docker --version
docker compose version

4.	Then do same project folder in vs code
5.	In ubuntu terminal run:
docker compose up –build
Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
Go to ubuntu firefox and put it
THIS IS MUCH EASIER IS MA’AM ACCEPTS DO THIS
IF YOU HAVE TO PUSH TO DOCKER HUB FROM UBUNTU:
docker build -t yourusername/microservice-app ./app
docker login
docker push yourusername/microservice-app

VIVA QUESTIONS:
Q: What is Docker?
A: Docker is a platform that lets us package applications into containers, which run the same everywhere regardless of the environment.

Q: What is a container?
A: A container is a lightweight, standalone package that contains everything needed to run a program (code, dependencies, runtime, etc.).

Q: What is the use of Dockerfile?
A: Dockerfile contains instructions to build a Docker image. It tells Docker how to set up the environment and run the application.

Q: What is Docker Compose?
A: Docker Compose is a tool used to run and manage multiple Docker containers using a single YAML file.

Q: What is a microservice?
A: A microservice is a small, independent service that performs a single function and can communicate with other services over a network.
